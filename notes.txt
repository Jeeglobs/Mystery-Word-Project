// FROM CLASS //
1. Open file, read it, make it into a list of words (slice on new-line). Words in the file are separated by newlines.

2. Select a random word.

3. Show number of letters in word, as underscores.

4. Ask user to guess.
    -- Keep a count of wrong guesses.
        --If the guess is wrong, tell the user that it's wrong.
    -- Keep track of the correct letters guessed.
        -- If a guess is correct, display it like, B__BA_D

5. Repeat step 4 until user reaches 8 guesses or they guess all the letters in the word correctly.
    -- If user reaches 8 wrong guesses, break and tell them they are out of guesses and reveal the word.
    -- If the user guesses the word, tell them they are right.

6. Ask if they want to play again. If so, go back to step 2.
